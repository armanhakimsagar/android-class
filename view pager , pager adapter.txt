* view pager: View pager found in Support Library in Android, using view pager we can switch the fragments.

* pager adapter: view pager get control from pager adapter. it have 4 methods:

	instantiateItem(ViewGroup, int): 

in this method we have to inflate the layout which which will represent a page for the given position.

	destroyItem(ViewGroup, int, Object): 

in this method we have to write the code that removes a page from its container for the given position. 
This method is called while the user navigates through pages. 
For example if the current position is 0 and the user navigates to the next page, 
which will be on position 1, at this point, the method is not called. But, 
when the user goes again to a next page, position 2, at this point, the page from position 0 will be removed. 
And from now on, whenever the user swipes to a next page the method will be called for the next positions, 1, 2 and so on.

	getCount(): 

here we have to provide the number of pages that the viewPager will have to display. 
In our case, the size of list containing our images which is 3 ðŸ™‚

	isViewFromObject(View, Object): 

it is required for a PagerAdapter in order for it to function properly. 
It checks if Object (the one returned by instantiateItem(ViewGroup, int)) is the same with View.











/// Project slider ////

Steps:

1. take a view pager in activity main xml (parent component)

2. create a child component & take imageview in it 

3. create a java model with constructor & getter setter (slidermodel)

4. create a adapter extends pager adapter.

		instantiateItem-> for inflate parent component
						  find view by id of child component
		                  by set image resource link between parent & child component
						  
		isViewFromObject-> it checked return view is object
		
		destroyItem-> it remove the current view.
		
		getCount-> return size of the array
		
		
5. create a array list in main activity. 

   create object of slider adapter & pass array
