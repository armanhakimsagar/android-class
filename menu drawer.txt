explain:

* toolbar :

In order to slide our navigation drawer over the ActionBar, we need to use the new Toolbar widget as defined in the AndroidX library.
The ActionBar displayed at the top.
 

* ActionBarDrawerToggle : 

The ActionBarDrawerToggle sets up the app icon located on the left of the action bar or toolbar to open and close the navigation drawer. 

* Drawer widget : 

DrawerLayout acts as a top-level container for window content that allows for interactive "drawer" views to be pulled 
out from one or both vertical edges of the window.

tools:openDrawer="start" property is used to display the navigation drawer when the XML layout is open in Android Studio design view.

* Navigation view :

NavigationView is generally placed inside a DrawerLayout.
Its use to inflate menu item

* HeaderView :

 This View is typically displayed at the top of the Navigation Drawer.
 This view is defined in a separate layout
 the app:headerLayout parameter is used
 
 
 * Menu : 
 
 This is displayed below the HeaderView and it contains all the navigation items in the form of a list.
 app:menus parameter is used
 
 
 * CoordinatorLayout :
 
 CoordinatorLayout that holds a ToolBar, a FloatingActionButton and a on_load_view.xml layout
 This is layout which hold top left floating button, on load view page
 
 * MainActivity:
 
The MainActivity implements NavigationView.OnNavigationItemSelectedListener and overrides the method onNavigationItemSelected. 
We handle the menu item clicks here and close the Drawer towards the left. 

* toggle.syncState() sync state: 

will synchronise the icon’s state and display the hamburger icon or back arrow depending on whether the drawer is closed or open. 
Omitting this line of code won’t change the back arrow to the hamburger icon when the drawer is closed. 
 
* drawer.closeDrawer(GravityCompat.START) direction state : 

is used to close the drawer by setting the gravity to START(left by default)
